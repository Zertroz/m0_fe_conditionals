# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators? Fairly confident. I, of course, still need to think through everything to make sure it fits together correctly. = and === is still the biggest issue.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators? Logical operators make sense to me, and I think I have a solid understanding of them.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements? Again, something I need to think through but I haven't encountered any significant challenges thus far.
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate? This ended up taking longer than I was expecting. Part of that was because I wanted to complete challenge 3, but couldn't figure out. Eventually I settled for challenge 2 and may go back to challenge 1 later. Still, it hasn't completely thrown off my schedule for the day, though I may have to work a little later than I have previously.
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that? Nothing immediate, though practice will need to be done eventually. I hope to do that on Friday and Sunday, before evaluations on Monday.
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need? Seriously, I wanna figure out challenge 3, but a few Google searches only lead me to being more confused. Problem for antoher day, I suppose?*

*Addendum: A friend of mine explained how the modulo works, so with that I was able to complete challenge 3. To be clear, she didn't write the code for me, she just explained how it works.
